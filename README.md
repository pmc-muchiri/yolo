# YOLO E-Commerce App(yolomy)

## About Application
A full-stack e-commerce platform built using the MERN stack `(MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js)`, featuring fashion and clothing products.
This project demonstrates containerized microservices for the frontend, backend, and database using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the YOLO E-Commerce App locally using Docker.
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pmc-muchiri/yolo.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd yolo
```
### Create and Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root or rename `.env.sample`

## Features
- Modular microservice structure (frontend, backend, database)
- Fully orcharstrated with `Docker` and `Docker Compose`
- MongoDB database integration
- Lightweight images and production-ready (Alpine-based)
- Secure environment variable management with `.env` file. a `.env.sample` file is provide

## Project Structure

```bash
yolo/
    ├─ backend/             
    │   └── Dockerfile
    ├─ client/              
    │   └── Dockerfile
    ├─ database/            
    │   └── Dockerfile
    ├─ docker-compose.yaml  
    ├─ .env                 
    └─ docs/
        └── images/
```          

## Step by Step Builing Containers
### Frontend Container
Build and test the frontend image  and test using this command

```bash
 docker image build -t alpine_image_image:v1.0.0 client/
 ```

You can verify using:

```bash
 docker images
 ```

![Test for Dockerfile images ](./docs/images/image-3.png)
    
Expected: The image builds successfully.

### BackEnd dockerfile

Create dockerfile and test using this command

``` docker image build -t alpine_image_image:v1.0.0 backend/```

![Test for Dockerfile images ](./docs/images/image.png)
    
after building confirm the image that has been built as well.

``` docker images ```

![Test for Dockerfile images ](./docs/images/image-5.png)
    
Using multi-stage builds with alpine base reduces the final image size significantly.

### Database Dockerfile

A lightweight MongoDB database container built from a custom Dockerfile.
    


### 2 Docker-compose file
Create docker-compose.yaml (compose.yml)

Step 1: Set up your first microservice (database container using MongoDB).
- Use MongoDB image version 3.0 as your base image.
- Configure authentication credentials (username and password) via an external .env file.
- Bind the service port to the host using `2017:2017`
- Create a custom Docker network and connect the MongoDB container to it.
- Set up a storage by creating a volume and attaching it to the MongoDB container to preserve data across restarts.

Step 2: Create the Backend Container
- Tag the image with a suitable name and version, for example: `pmcmuchiri/pmc-yolo-client:v1.0.0`
- Specify the build path, such as `/backend`
- Run interactively which is optional (docker run -it)
- Attach the container to the previously created network to enable communication with other services.

### Running the Application

Once all Dockerfiles are ready, start the services with:

```bash
 docker-compose up --build 
 ```

To run in detached mode:

```bash
docker-compose up -d 
```

### Stop and Clean Up
To stop running containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To remove containers, networks, and volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### FInal Images 
Here are the final images less than 400mbs

![alt text](/docs/images/image-6.png)

Then visit Frontend -> [Yolo Website](http://localhost:8080) and upload your product.

### Dockerhub Images 
These are the images that I pyshed to dockerhub

You can view, pull, or use these images directly from my Docker Hub repository: [Dockerhub-pmcmuchiri](https://hub.docker.com/repositories/pmcmuchiri)

# Automated Provisioning with Ansible and Vagrant

To simplify deployment and ensure environment consistency, I have integrated Ansible and Vagrant for full automation of the Dockerized YOLO app.

## How It Works

- Vagrant provisions an Ubuntu geerlingguy/ubuntu2004 virtual machine (VM) using VirtualBox.

- Once the VM is created, Ansible automatically:
    - Installs Docker and required dependencies.
    - Pulls the following pre-built Docker images from Docker Hub
        - frontend. 
        - backend.
        - database.
    - Creates and connects the necessary Docker networks.
    - Runs the containers with proper port mappings.

## Containers Deployed

|       Service       | Image                                         | Port Mapping          |
|---------------------| ----------------------------------------------| ----------------------|
|       Frontend      | `pmcmuchiri/pmc-yolo-client:v1.0.1`           | `8080:80`             |
|       Backend       | `pmcmuchiri/pmc-yolo-backend:v1.0.1`          | `5000:5000`           |
|       Database      | `pmcmuchiri/pmc-yolo-database:v1.0.1`         | `27017:27017`         |

```
### inventory.yml
- Here I defines the Ansible inventory.
    - specifies the host(s) Ansible connects to.
    - In this setup, it points to the Vagrant VM running locally over SSH.
    - It tells Ansible where to execute tasks.

### playbook.yml
- The entry point for Ansible automation.
- Defines which hosts to target and which roles to execute in sequence.

### vars/all.yml
- Central configuration file for environment variables and container settings.
- Contains definitions like:
    - Docker image names and tags

    - Container ports

    - Network names

    - MongoDB credentials

    - Application base paths
- Itkeeps configuration declarative, centralised, and easily adjustable without touching playbooks.

### Roles
- Roles divide automation into modular components, each responsible for one layer of the stack.

1. common/ : Handles system setup and prerequisites.

 Tasks include:

  - Updating packages and installing Docker, git, and curl

  - Adding the vagrant user to the Docker group

  - Cloning the application repository

  - Creating Docker networks for service communication

  - It prepares the base environment shared by all services.

2. db/

- Manages the MongoDB container.

- Key tasks:

    - Pulls MongoDB image from Docker Hub

    - Ensures a persistent data volume exists

    - Runs the MongoDB container with authentication and port mapping
    
    - It sets up the database layer.

3. backend/

- Deploys the Node.js/Express API service.

- Key tasks:

    - Creates the backend directory

    - Pulls the backend image from Docker Hub

    - Runs the backend container, linking it to both database and frontend networks

    - Exposes port 5000

4. frontend/

- Manages the React frontend container (served via Nginx).

- Key tasks:

    - Pulls the prebuilt frontend image

    - Runs the container, exposing it on port 80

    - Connects it to the frontend-backend-net network

### Vagrantfile

- Defines the virtual machine configuration for the deployment environment.

- Creates a consistent, reproducible environment for the entire stack — from OS setup to running containers.


## Setting Up the Environment

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash

git clone https://github.com/pmc-muchiri/yolo

cd yolo

```

**Step 2: Start the Virtual Machine**

```bash

vagrant up

```

This command:

- Spins up an Ubuntu **geerlingguy/ubuntu2004** VM.

- Automatically runs Ansible to:

- Install Docker & dependencies.

- Create app directories and Docker networks.

- Pull prebuilt Docker images from Docker Hub.

- Run all containers with proper environment variables and ports.

Once provisioning is complete ssh into the vm using this command
```bash

vagrant ssh

```
![alt text](image-3.png)

Then Run this command

```bash

Docker ps

```
![alt text](image-4.png)

## Test Connection
Test connection inside VM using this command

```bash

curl localhost

```
This is the expected outcome if it’s working
![alt text](./ansible_screenshots/image-5.png)

## Access the app from your host machine:
- Frontend → http://localhost:8080

## Cleanup Commands

To stop all containers:

```bash

docker compose down

```
To destroy the VM completely:

```bash

vagrant destroy -f

```

To reprovision a fresh setup:

```bash

vagrant up --provision

```
